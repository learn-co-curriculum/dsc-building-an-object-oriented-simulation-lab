    "    * That this statistic is accurate\n",
    "    \n",
    "Building simulations is always a trade-off since the real world is very, very complex.  As you build the simulation, try to think about ways in which you could make our model more realistic by writing it in such a way that it eliminates one of the assumptions above (e.g. generating a float value for vaccine efficacy on a person-by-person level to eliminate our first assumption). \n",

Specifically, in this lab, you demonstrated mastery of using inheritance to write nonredundant code, creating methods that calculate statistics of the attributes of an object, and creating Object-Oriented data models that describe the real world with multiple classes and subclasses and interaction between classes!"
